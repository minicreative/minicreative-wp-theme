# MiniCreative Web Base

WebBase is a collection of fundamental SCSS & JS for new MiniCreative development projects. It includes several third party libraries, including jQuery and php-sass. It is configured to work out of the box for new WordPress and ProcessWire projects.

The following files / directories are specifically included:
* `js/main.js` (base / reusable JavaScript functions)
* `scss/main.scss` (base / reusable CSS styles)
* `plugins` (3rd party libraries and plugins)
* `sass_compiler` (PHP SASS compiler library)
* `wp_base` and `wp_includes` (abstract WordPress files)
* `pw_base` and `pw_includes` (abstract ProcessWire files)

## Setup

### Setup with Gulp
1. Install yarn and yarn packages.  
2. Create `environment.json` in the root directory and include the following:
* `cms` as either `wordpress` or `processwire`
3. Run `gulp structure`

### Setup without Gulp
Run `cp -a ./BASE/. .` where BASE is `wp_base` or `pw_base`

## ProcessWire notes

Create a `scss/site.scss` with `@import "../scss/main.scss";` at the top.
Add project-specific includes and files to `pw_site` directory.
Add a `sendgridkey.php` file to `pw_includes` with `$sendgridkey = "SENDGRID_API_KEY";`
